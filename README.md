HYT221 humidity sensor and I2c circuit
I want to integrate the HYT221 humidity sensor to the I2C circuit with the digital readout and input buttons to set the humidity.  I want to turn a fan on when humidity is below 80%, and run a pump when the tank is at a certain level.  I need the wiring diagram and the program.
